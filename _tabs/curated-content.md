Here, you will find resources that I find incredibly useful for learning new skills and concepts. I’m trying my best to find materials that are either free or not bank-breaking, but are of high enough quality to stand on their own.

# Linux

- [Linux Basics for Hackers](https://nostarch.com/linuxbasicsforhackers) : Probably one of the best books to get started with Linux, with the added benefits of being intended for people interested in ethical hacking. Even if you’re not, it is still a resource very worthy of your time.
- [linuxjourney.com](https://linuxjourney.com/) : Even though it might look simplistic at first glance, Linux Journey provides solid foundations. Its structured approach is very digestible, and it will take you from novice to an advanced and comfortable user. Highly recommended.
- [How Linux Works](https://nostarch.com/howlinuxworks3) : Once familiar with Linux, I can only recommend this book if you want to go into details, it is more technical and therefore a bit dry to read, but is still a very valuable resource for those hungry for deeper knowledge.

# Programming
- [devdocs.io](https://devdocs.io/) : You can never go wrong with official documentation ; it might be difficult to read and understand at times, but it's **essential** to know how to read it. This website gathers most documentations in one place.
- [project-based-learning](https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning) : As good as the documentation or references are, learning a programming language **MUST** be paired with projects. This is how knowledge truly sticks in the brain. This repository gathers all kinds of projects if you don't have any in mind.
- [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/) : An **INVALUABLE** resource for C++ programmers (from beginners to advanced). It covers most concepts in an easy-to-understand way and provides examples. A no-brainer bookmark.


# Networking
- [Cisco Networking Academy](https://www.netacad.com/) : A very solid resource for learning networking. Although it’s vendor-oriented, the skills acquired there are applicable to any context. The fact that courses are interactive with Cisco Packet Tracers, combining theory and practice, is a huge plus. I recommend starting with [Networking Essentials](https://www.netacad.com/courses/networking/networking-essentials).
- [networkacademy.io](https://www.networkacademy.io/) : Another good resource, also vendor-oriented toward Cisco, with a course to prepare for the CCNA. Unfortunately, it’s still being updated at the moment, but the parts that are online are good quality.

# Git

- [Official documentation](https://devdocs.io/git/) : Just like programming, the official documentation is always a good bookmark to have at hand.
- [learngitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) : An interactive, solid tutorial to learn Git. It covers concepts and scenarios you’ll encounter in real-life development, rather than overwhelming you with every single argument you’ll never use.

# Ethical hacking

- [The AllTheThings repos](https://github.com/swisskyrepo) : Litteral treasure chests, here are the individual link you should explore and always keep these at hands. Also, feel free to support [Swissky](https://github.com/swisskyrepo) for his **MASSIVE** work.

    - [Payloads All The Things](https://swisskyrepo.github.io/PayloadsAllTheThings/)
    - [Hardware All The Things](https://swisskyrepo.github.io/HardwareAllTheThings/)
    - [Internal All The Things](https://swisskyrepo.github.io/InternalAllTheThings/)

- [hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/) : Another great project offering qualitative and free ressources, based on the author's experience doing CTFs, real life pentesting and researches.
