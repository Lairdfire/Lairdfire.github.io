Here, you will find resources that I find incredibly useful for learning new skills and concepts. I’m trying my best to find materials that are either free or not bank-breaking, but are of high enough quality to stand on their own. 

# Linux

## Books
- [Linux Basics for Hackers](https://nostarch.com/linuxbasicsforhackers)
Probably one of the best books to get started with Linux, with the added benefits of being intended for people interested in ethical hacking. Even if you’re not, it is still a resource very worthy of your time.
- [How Linux Works](https://nostarch.com/howlinuxworks3)
Once familiar with Linux, I can only recommend this book if you want to go into details, it is more technical and therefore a bit dry to read, but is still a very valuable resource for those hungry for deeper knowledge.

## Websites
- [linuxjourney.com](https://linuxjourney.com/)
Even though it might look simplistic at first glance, Linux Journey provides solid foundations. Its structured approach is very digestible, and it will take you from novice to an advanced and comfortable user. Highly recommended.
