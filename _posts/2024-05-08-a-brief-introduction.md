## Welcome to my personal journey into ethical hacking
### Introduction
Hello and welcome to my blog where I will document my personal transition into the world of cybersecurity. My goal is to share the insights and experiences I gain along the way, and to provide resources for those who wish to follow a similar path.

### My Story
Two years ago, I witnessed the beginning of the slow degradation of my work environment. The thought of switching careers was already running in my head at the time, and I believed it was the right time to make a change, while it was still possible. I always had an interest in computers, fixing and building them myself, even helping around when I could. So, it was only natural that I looked into this field to make a new career and started taking evening classes for a bachelor’s degree in computer science.

### The Turning Point
I’ve always been fascinated by hacking. How one can manage to enter secure systems has always piqued my interest. However, this world always seemed like a distant reality for me, reserved only for a small minority of highly intelligent and/or gifted people. But my preconceived notions got challenged when I stumbled upon numerous platforms designed to teach hacking with a structured path (in my case, TryHackMe.com), covering many aspects of the field from the ground up.

It was an eye-opening experience. The more I learned, the more I wanted. It was a rabbit hole in which I dived headfirst despite the difficulty and my lack of knowledge. It was clear that cybersecurity was a good fit for me. The blend of creativity, analytical thinking, and pursuit of knowledge did align with my own values.

### Learning Pause
Unfortunately, when my classes started, I had to take a break from ethical hacking. I worked shifts at the time and, combined with the evening classes, it was a huge mental load and I had to make a choice. I did not regret it, because the knowledge acquired during classes laid some solid foundations (notably programming in C) and filled gaps I had while I was learning ethical hacking on my own.

### The next chapter
Now, I find myself at a crossroads once again. I am ready to dive back into the world of cybersecurity and am eager to resume my learning. My goal is to secure a position as a penetration tester. I am excited about the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, and I look forward to sharing my continued journey with you all.
