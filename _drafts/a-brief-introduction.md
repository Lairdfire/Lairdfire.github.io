# Welcome into my personal journey into ethical hacking.

## Introduction
Hello and welcome to my blog where I will document my personal transition into the world of cybersecurity. My goal is to share the insights and experiences I gain along the way, and to provide resources for those who wish to follow a similar path.

## My story
2 years ago, I witnessed the beginning of the slow degradation of my work environment, the thought of switching career was already running in my head at the time and I believed it was the right time to make a change, while it was still possible. I always had an interest in computers, fixing and building them myself, even helped around when I could, so it's only naturally that I looked into this field to make a new career and started taking evening classes for a bachelor in computer sciences.

By the time I signed up for classes, there were a few monthes left to kill before they started, started to dive into hacking and found a real calling in this field.
