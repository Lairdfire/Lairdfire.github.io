Hey y'all, I'm Arnaud, a former train driver from Belgium, now venturing into the world of cybersecurity. 

I chose this career path because I've always had a fascination with computers and hacking. I remember an event when I was twelve where older students gave us a multiple-choice test they had created themselves, which I figured out how to cheat. This impressed my classmates, and while it was nothing of a hack, it planted the seed of curiosity into my brain.

For some reason, I strayed away from this interest, pursuing other activities like being a lazy, immature teenagerâ€”a passion at which I excelled. After a difficult attempt at college where my mental health severely declined, I found myself on the job market and had to quickly grow up and adapt. After a couple of years of searching and training to become a machinist, I got a job as a train driver by chance.

It was good while it lasted, but unfortunately, the prime evil that is new management took a foothold in the company, leading to idiotic decisions that lead to a general degradation of the company's well being, includind mine. 

. However, I'm choosing to see the positive side of this experience. I was smart enough to sign up for night classes for a Bachelor's in Information Technology when the work environment began to decline and to take a leave of absence for medical reasons when my well-being severely deteriorated.



Right now, I'm focused on my career change, learning a ton of cool stuff and trying to get interviews to gain experience, my focus is on becoming a SOC analyst and I'll be very happy to shre my journey with you.
